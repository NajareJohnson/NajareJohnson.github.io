Week one of my DREAM project has officially begun, and we kicked things off with a meeting with my mentor and research advisor. Dr. Madisetti is guiding me through my professional journey and providing valuable PhD support. During our meeting, we explored how the DREAM project aligns with my research goals and upcoming endeavors. 

Dr. Kim, my research advisor and a professor at the University of South Florida, also joined the discussion. USF's Pathways to Computing Certificate Program, which is similar to the DREAM program, helps non-CS majors transition into the field. This initiative exemplifies the power of collaboration across disciplines. 

This week, our focus was on establishing regular meeting times and selecting the productivity tools we will use for collaboration.
