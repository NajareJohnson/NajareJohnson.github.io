Week two of my DREAM project has been both productive and enlightening. This week, we made significant strides in planning and refining our approach as part of Module 1 of the DREAM program. 

First on our agenda was scheduling a recurring meeting with Dr. Madisetti. We’ve now set up regular check-ins to ensure consistent progress and maintain alignment with my research objectives. During our discussion, we also reviewed previous PhD students' research that closely resembles my proposed project. Dr. Madisetti provided valuable insights into their work, helping me better understand how to navigate potential challenges and leverage successful strategies from their experiences. 

Additionally, I had a fruitful meeting with Dr. Kim, where we delved deeper into the DREAM project and explored various facets of the program. This conversation was instrumental in clarifying some aspects of the program and understanding how to make the most out of this opportunity. 

Overall, this week has been about laying a solid foundation for the project. Establishing a regular meeting schedule with Dr. Madisetti and gaining a clearer perspective on my project’s context and the DREAM program itself are crucial steps as we progress through Module 1. I’m excited to continue building on this momentum and look forward to the next phases of the project.
